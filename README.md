# Computer-Architecture
This project is about improving image quality by reducing noise. It involves converting 24bpp PPM P6 color images to grayscale and applying noise reduction using a Laplace filter with blurring. I developed four different algorithms to do this more efficiently, with changes in computation order and parallel processing to speed things up.
